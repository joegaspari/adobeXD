# adobeXD
This repository will store the adobe XD projects I have been building over the last couple of months. I began learning this software at the end of January as it relates to a class (Human Computer Interaction) that I am currently enrolled in. I have found the software extremely fun and thus have been building more projects that stem from personal interests.


# Dish'D

Dish'D is a foodie inspired UI that allows users to come together to share the food they love, with the people that will appreciate them. 



# FLIX 

Following an HTA built to model the flow an organizer would take to schedule a movie with any number of friends. FLIX allows the user to preview trailers of new movies playing in theatre now. Users can add friends and plan events for future movies from trailers they see on the main screen.
